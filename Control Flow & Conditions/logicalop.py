# Basic maths

a = 5;
b = 7;
print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a/b)
print(a*b)
print(a%b) #Remainder


# Logical Operator
# and (Both should be true)

a = 5;
b = 5;
c=4

if a==5 and b==5:
    print(True); # This will print true because both the condition are true


#or operator (Any one condition is true will give true)
if a==5 or c==5:
    print(True) #here since a==5 it will print true if consition doesn't meet then it will rpint nothing
