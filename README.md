  <h1>Python Programming</h1>
  <p>This repository contains my coursework and assignments for the Python Programming course on Coursera. The course covers a range of topics, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic Python syntax and programming concepts</li>
    <li>Control flow structures such as if/else statements and loops</li>
    <li>Functions and data structures such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries</li>
    <li>Error handling and exceptions</li>
    <li>File input/output and handling</li>
    <li>Procedural programming concepts</li>
    <li>Functional programming concepts</li>
    <li>Object-oriented programming (OOP) and classes</li>
    <li>Modules, popular packages, libraries, and frameworks</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The repository is organized into subdirectories for each week of the course, along with a separate directory for graded assignments. Each subdirectory contains code examples and exercises for the topics covered in that week, and the graded assignments directory contains completed assignments.</p>
  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>To get started with the course materials, clone the repository to your local machine and open the relevant subdirectory for the week or assignment you're working on. Each directory contains a README file with instructions and explanations for the code examples and exercises.</p>
  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
  <p>To run the Python code in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. The code examples and exercises were developed using Python 3.9, but should be compatible with other versions of Python 3.</p>
